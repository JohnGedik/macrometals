# Macro Metals Monitor

An editorial macro research site focused on gold, silver, oil, and their relationships to the wider economy. The web app lives in [`web/`](web/).

## Run locally

```powershell
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The journal and seeded sample articles render without Supabase credentials; authentication, comments, profile storage, and newsletter persistence require a Supabase project.

## Supabase setup

1. Copy `web/.env.example` to `web/.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from the Supabase project settings.
2. Apply [`web/supabase/migrations/20261107000000_initial_schema.sql`](web/supabase/migrations/20261107000000_initial_schema.sql) in the Supabase SQL editor or with the Supabase CLI.
3. In Supabase Authentication, enable Google and email providers. Email login uses a passwordless sign-in link. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` and the deployed callback URL to the allowed redirect URLs.
4. Configure the Google OAuth client ID and secret in Supabase, and set its callback URL to the Supabase-provided Google provider callback.

Profile and comment ownership is enforced by row-level security. Avatar uploads are limited to the signed-in user's storage folder. Newsletter addresses can be inserted but are not readable through the public API.

## Routes

- `/` publication home
- `/articles/[slug]` article, comments, share links, and social metadata
- `/tag/[tag]` related articles
- `/search?q=...` title, summary, and tag search
- `/author/[slug]` author profile and articles
- `/login` Google or email-link sign-in
- `/profile` signed-in profile and avatar editor

## Writing articles

Each article is a Markdown document at `web/content/articles/<slug>/index.md`. YAML frontmatter defines its `id`, `slug`, `title`, `summary`, `coverImage`, `publishedAt`, `tags`, and `author`; the document body supports standard Markdown. Keep the article `id` aligned with its row in the Supabase `articles` table so comments continue to reference the correct article.

Email login is passwordless by default. Replies, voting, likes, forums, messaging, AI chat, and paid subscriptions are not implemented.
